# outline-go-tun2socks

Go package for building [go-tun2socks](https://github.com/eycorsican/go-tun2socks)-based clients for [Outline](https://getoutline.org) and [Intra](https://getintra.org) (now with support for [Choir](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/choir) metrics).  For macOS, iOS, and Android, the output is a library; for Linux and Windows it is a command-line executable.

## Prerequisites

- macOS host (iOS, macOS)
- Xcode (iOS, macOS)
- make
- Go >= 1.14
- A C compiler (e.g.: clang, gcc)
- [gomobile](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile) (iOS, macOS, Android)
- [xgo](https://github.com/techknowlogick/xgo) (Windows, Linux)
- Docker (Windows, Linux)
- Other common utilities (e.g.: git)

## macOS Framework

As of Go 1.14, gomobile does not support building frameworks for macOS. We have patched gomobile to enable building a framework for macOS by replacing the default iOS simulator build.

Until we upstream the change, the (Darwin) binary to enable this behavior is located at `tools/gomobile` and is used by the `build_macos.sh` build script.


## Linux & Windows

We build binaries for Linux and Windows from source without any custom integrations. `xgo` and Docker are required to support cross-compilation.

## Build
```bash
go get -d ./...
./build_[ios|android|macos|windows].sh
```
# Virtual Machine

## Ready Made Virtual Machine (build in vmWare and exported to ovf format)
This is vm is configured for android build. All libraries, android ndk and sdk are configured. Just plug and Play
